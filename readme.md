# Create a Quiz

For this assignment, I was to create a quiz with a few sporadic features added in.

## Criteria

According to the user story, I was to create a quiz with the following acceptance criteria. 

The quiz starts when user clicks a start button

A timer starts and the user is presented with a question

When one question is answered, another appears

When a question is answered incorrectly, the timer is decremented 15 seconds

The quiz had to stop asking questions when the clock reached 0 or the user completed all questions

After the quiz was over, the user could save their initials and score. 

## Known Issues 
The program doesn't work. 
Function to answer questions is not written
Function to decrement time from clock is not written
Function to bring new questions up is not written
Function to track score is not written
Function to save initials not written
Only 2 out of 10 questions written. 

##  Current Development Notes
Start Button -> Timer
Question pops up
4 answer buttons
Answering question logs score, takes you to next question, deducts time if false
Stop questions when question 10 is answers or time === 0
Display score and a button allowing you to save your initials to leaderboard/footer
write function for footer to prompt and change leaderboard 

## Future Development Notes
Leaderboard saves time taken as well?
Track highest score on leaderboard, not just last 
Try again button (my just have reload())
Add buttons for different quizzes, including endless mode. 
Add display section for if user input correct or incorrect answer
