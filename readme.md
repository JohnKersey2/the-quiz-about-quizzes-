## Criteria

According to the user story, I was to create a quiz with the following acceptance criteria. 

The quiz starts when user clicks a start button

A timer starts and the user is presented with a question

When one question is answered, another appears

When a question is answered incorrectly, the timer is decremented 15 seconds

The quiz had to stop asking questions when the clock reached 0 or the user completed all questions

After the quiz was over, the user could save their initials and score. 

## Known Issues 
Font Sizes for large viewports need to be adjusted for gradeBox and leaderboard

## Fixed Issues 
Function to save initials written

Footer to show saved score implemented

##  Current Development Notes
Change initial input to only take alphabet characters

Refactor and consolidate code 

## Future Development Notes
Potential features to add:

Change functionality of scoreboard to only show highest score, or if possible, 3 highest scores

Add final question that asks how many times you clicked the A answer?

Add time taken to complete to scoreboard

Add buttons for different quizzes.

Add endless mode.
